Conversational AI for Promoting Positive Behavioral Change
This study aims to identify the most suitable algorithm for developing chatbot-based interventions to promote mental wellness among college students in San Pablo City, Laguna. Given the rise in mental health issues among college students, existing solutions often lack timely and personalized support. Researchers have thus explored chatbot-based interventions using advanced AI methodologies. The algorithms evaluated include Feed-forward Neural Network (FFNN), Naive Bayes, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The comparative analysis focuses on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results indicate that SVM outperforms the other algorithms with the highest accuracy (76.33%), precision (76.43%), recall (74.89%), and F1 score (73.30%). FFNN also shows robust performance with 71.88% accuracy, 71.13% precision, 70.40% recall, and 69.12% F1 score. In contrast, BiLSTM and Naive Bayes exhibit moderate to lower performance metrics, with BiLSTM achieving 65.63% accuracy, 61% precision, 61% recall, and 60% F1 score, and Naive Bayes showing 61% accuracy, 56.72% precision, 62.33% recall, and 56.60% F1 score. Challenges arose due to dataset imbalance, affecting the anticipated performance and overall effectiveness. Despite these setbacks, the study provides valuable insights, highlighting the potential of conversational AI in promoting mental well-being among college students. In conclusion, SVM demonstrates strong capability in delivering mental health support compared to other algorithms. Despite challenges such as dataset imbalance, SVM emerged as a viable choice for developing conversational AI solutions. Future research should focus on expanding datasets, conducting usability testing, and investigating the long-term impact of chatbot interventions on mental health outcomes.
